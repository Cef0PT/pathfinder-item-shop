Inside, a tiny compartment usually contains smelling salts (page 101) or alchemist's kindness (page 100).

When activated, the white pearl detects poison in a 10- foot radius around the wearer, dulling to a dark gray if poison is within range. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a delay poison spell. The silver pearl detects diseases in a 10-foot radius, turning bright blue on discovery. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a remove disease spell.
