A crown of heaven bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown.

Donning or removing the hood requires 1 minute, or 5 rounds with assistance. As with a normal hoodwink cowl, the wearer of a sensory deprivation hood is blinded, deafened, and takes a -10 penalty on all other Perception checks. If the wearer has blindsense, blindsight, tremorsense, or a similar ability, he can take a full-round action to suppress those senses for as long as he wears the hood or until he resumes using them (which requires another full-round action). If the wearer is currently benefitting from one of these senses, he gains no benefits from the hood. As long as the wearer's senses are suppressed, he gains the ability to perform automatic writing, dowsing, and psychometry even if he doesn't have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat. If he does have psychic spellcasting or the Psychic Sensitivity feat, he gains a +5 bonus on skill checks for those skill unlocks. Additionally, once per day while wearing the sensory deprivation hood, the wearer can open up his mind to passing spiritual phenomena in the hope of gaining greater insight into a specific issue. This functions as contact other plane, allowing the wearer to ask up to 5 questions per use, but rather than contacting an entity on another plane of existence, the wearer contacts a nearby spirit or other psychic entity.

25,Slaying Arrow,Ultimate Equipment,strong,strong necromancy,13.0,none,"2,282 gp",1/10 lb.,"This +1 arrow is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 50 points of damage. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus death ward protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.
